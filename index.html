<b>World Wide Web</b>

<p>

The World Wide Web is a collection of HTML documents. Those documents in turn are made up of something called HTML - <em>HyperText Markup Language</em>.
HTML is the basis of almost every page you encounter. The links between the pages that you see, are called <b>hyperlinks</b>. They are what makes the web, web-like.

<p>

<b>Internet</b>

<p>
You access the World Wide Web through your computer by using an application called a <b>browser</b>. Computers communicate with other computers or servers using <b>HTTP protocol</b>. 
A browser's main function is to display the information we typically associate with a website such as text, images, videos and more.

<p>

<b>Elements and Tags</b>

<p>
HTML documents are made up by <b>HTML elements</b>. Elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, and with the content in between. The HTML element 
is everything between the start tag and the end tag.
